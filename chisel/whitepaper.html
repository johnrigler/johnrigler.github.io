    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Today’s social platforms are centralized ad markets with editorial power. They must operate this way in order to offer the 
      free and convenient services that we have grown accustomed to. But these are technology traps that we can
      avoid.  We no longer need to relying on centralized corporations that  gate identity,
      throttle reach, and monetize surveillance. If you want a different outcome, you must change the substrate:
      put identity and data under their own programatic and decentralized control, store content on decentralized media, 
      and make the “feed” a local program—not a centralized service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Bitcoin solved the Byzantine Generals problem with proof-of-work, we have had a possible alternative digital
      medium which we could manage ourselves. Crypto ledgers are not just arbitrary money systems, they are also arbitrary
      data and communication systems. Large well-funded efforts in decentralization or Web3 generally fail because they 
      introduce points of centralization which seem necessary. They either do this because of a failure of imagination or
      a lack of true vision and sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe in the spirit of the common person. We believe in the power of collaboration. We believe in true competition,
      true free enterprise, and the uncensored wisdom of exceptional individual over the madness of crowds or the 
      pessimism of oligarchy. The Hobbesian Leviathan is born of fear, emits fear, and stifles innovation. This new "Digital Leviathan" 
      posits that no single person has moral authority over any other. By creating a medium of communication based on 
      individuals burning tiny bits of money into words, we avoid the technology traps of Web2. 
    </p>
    <p>
     This white paper does not speculate about the future, but instead points out what has always been possible. The innovations of
     Chisel, Web3, and this Digital Leviathan show how Web3 can be easier and more accessible, but the substrate can not be 
     destroyed or unmade without also destroying all proof-of-work blockchain ledgers (cryptocurrencies). Upon realizing that
     this is neither a joke nor a projection, most people become somewhat fearful. But I would ask one question: "When I first realized
     what this system confirms, should I have told anyone at all?" Most people seem happy that I have explained this to them, but
     then come to believe that this information should be kept from "those people". Even when I talk to those very "others", they 
     make the same observation. But as I have decide to share this information with all, these arguments become moot. We must believe
     that goodness will win the day, otherwise we are all lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Chisel</strong> is a minimal toolchain that etches arbitrary images, text, and URL links onto public blockchain ledgers.
      It is technically a series of "hacks" which disregard the wishes of the creators of such network. Its central premise is that the user is
      presenting the blockchain "miners" with a transaction and a small fee. Current blockchain wallets limit what is included in these 
      transactions AND require special software. But bitcoin was never initially about a set of expert curators. Any company, any committee,
      or any set of gatekeepers can be compromised. In the "Byzantine Generals" example, the message must go through. For it to be stopped 
      would be considered a "fault". Therefore, cryptocurrency is built of "Byzantine Fault Tolerance". We simply reframe the message payload
      to be more than simply a transfer of money.
      </p>
      <p>
      Chisel can be run from different sources. You can even download it to your own computer. If you want to run your own Digibyte server, 
      then you have another level of personal control of your ability to read and write to Web3. It may seem like this is all too difficult
      to COMPETE with things like Facebook or Youtube. Web3 is not about competition, but rather collaboration. This simply writes data to
      one of many immutable networks. This technology can easily be adapted to work with other bitcoin-like network.

        <h3>Centralized platforms: failure modes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Identity lock-in:</strong> accounts and graphs live under ToS, not keys.</li>
          <li><strong>Editorial opacity:</strong> feeds are pay-to-play, policy-driven, or “trust &amp; safety” opaque.</li>
          <li><strong>Data custody:</strong> uploads are hostage to rate limits, API changes, and bans.</li>
          <li><strong>Incentive mismatch:</strong> engagement extraction beats user agency.</li>
          <li><strong>API rug pulls:</strong> developer access changes kill third-party clients.</li>

      <div class="panel">
        <h3>Control requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keyed identity:</strong> self-sovereign IDs, no admin reset.</li>
          <li><strong>Permanent addressability:</strong> content address (IPFS) or ledger roots.</li>
          <li><strong>Local-first clients:</strong> the feed is computed locally from public data.</li>
          <li><strong>Auditable write-path:</strong> posts/follows have verifiable provenance.</li>

      The minimal guarantee: if your key signed it and the network finalized it, you can always

  <section id="how-chisel">
    <h2>2) How Chisel demonstrates feasibility (and why earlier PoS EVM variants aren’t trust-minimized)</h2>

    <h3>What Chisel is</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>On Digibyte (UTXO, PoW):</strong> a vanilla transaction template builder that “etches”
        statements into burn outputs and the <code>OP_RETURN</code> field. Human-readable <em>MacDougall</em> encodings
        act as semantic tags (subject, person, transport, etc.) is part of what makes it readable/findable.</li>
      <li><strong>Much of this seems easier on EVM:</strong> which uses <code>tx.data</code> or dumb contracts to embed data.
        Because Chisel support BIP32/38/39/44 keys, it could easily be extended into EVM and beyond, if desired. Having said that, 
        proof-of-stake ledgers appear to be curated/censored. </li>
      <li><strong>Client side:</strong>Vanilla JS act as a local explorer and feed composer.
        No external API requirements; No NodeJS/React/Cloud dependencies; IPFS hosting is supported.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="panel">
      <h3>Why UTXO + PoW for source of truth</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Finality via physics:</strong> reorg cost grows with hashrate and time; capture requires
            ongoing external energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Granular provenance:</strong> each inscription is an atomic, independently verifiable spend.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> fewer footguns than complex, upgradeable VM contracts.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Why earlier PoS EVM variants are insufficient as a root of trust</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Social finality &amp; governance capture:</strong> many PoS chains rely on governance to resolve
          long-range reorganizations and validator failures. This is de facto human arbitration.</li>
      <li><strong>Capital centralization:</strong> stake tends to concentrate; the set of entities that can
          censor or reorder is small.</li>
      <li><strong>Upgrade latitude:</strong> upgradable contracts and client coordination can rewrite application
          realities quickly. Good for shipping, bad for immutable attestations.</li>
      <li><strong>Sequencer bottlenecks (L2s):</strong> single or few sequencers introduce chokepoints even when
          data availability is on-chain.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="muted">
      Use PoS EVM chains for reach and interoperability. Use UTXO PoW for anchoring speech and identity claims
      you cannot afford to have socially reversed.
    </p>

  <section id="options">
    <h2>3) Options over monarchs: the Digital Leviathan</h2>
    <p>
      Hobbes’ Leviathan concentrates power to prevent chaos. Today’s “Monarchs” are platform operators:
      unitary actors that moderate, rank, and monetize speech. The <strong>Digital Leviathan</strong> functionally presented here
      redistributes power into protocols: speech is a public good (addressed, signed, archived), while selection
      and ranking are market-driven local computations that anyone can fork.
    </p>
    <div class="callout">
      <strong>The question:</strong> “If you know a different way is possible, should you share it or hide it?”
      <br/>Answer: publish the method. Let communities choose their clients and ranking functions.

    <h2>MacDougall (Unspendable) Addressing</h2>
    <p>
      MacDougall encodings create obviously unspendable, human-readable addresses that double as semantic labels.
      These get permanently etched on-ledger and are legible without custom software. This convention predates
      the Chisel project. In order to send to more than one crypto address (which is required for Chisel), you
      would traditionally need special skills and software, such as this Digibyte Core Server:
    </p>
    <img width=80% src="dgbCore.png"></img>
    <p>
    Noticie that even though you are technically looking at "fake" crypto addresses, you are still able to read them.
    Each of these gets indexed into standard block explorers or can be searched with an API. This begins to give
    you a searchability and a way for people to broadcast.
    </p>h
    <p>
    With my server, I could also subscribe to and watch for common readable patterns. This convention is called "MacDougall"
    and is both readable and indexable.
    </p>
    <img width=80% src="dgbYouTube.png"></img>
    <div class="panel">
      <h3>Prefix rules (abridged)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><code>D</code> = fixed first letter</li>
        <li><code>A|B|C|D|E</code> = modifier (2nd)</li>
        <li><code>x</code> as 3rd letter = space</li>
        <li><code>DAx</code> = person</li>
        <li><code>DBx</code> = transport (e.g., <code>DBxYoUTUBE</code>)</li>
        <li><code>DCx</code> = subject</li>
        <li><code>DDx</code>/<code>DEx</code> = an IPFS address will follow (split in half)</li>
        <li>If 2nd is <code>D</code> and 3rd != <code>x</code>, interpret as free verse/text</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Middle section = language. Capitals are literal, with small <code>o</code> and <code>i</code> included.
        <code>x</code> = space, <code>y</code> = dash, <code>z</code> = padding. Checksum closes the address.
      </p>
    </div>

    <pre>Example:
Input:  DCx domo arigato
Output: DCxDoMoxARiGATozzzzzzzzzzzzzVwQnWq  (human-legible + checksum)</pre>

    <p>
      These tags annotate transactions with durable, readable semantics—no ABI or indexer monopoly needed. Notice
      that if someone knows these addresses or "anchors" that they can query the ledger remotely. In this example,
      you can search on a 3rd party website. Without any formatting, you can read words and see URLs.
    </p>
   <img width=80% src="dgbEyes.png"></img>
  </section>
  <p>
  But now, Chisel allows this same freedom to read and write WITHOUT installing the nerd-centric Digibyte Core server. 
  This greatly reduces the cost of entry. It also adds new graphical protocols that will allow for simple images. Note
  that readability and viewability is greatly improved.

      Chisel shows that social media can be a local computation over public data, not a remote service with privileges.
      This interface is still too difficult for the general public, but it does function as a proof-of-concept. It can
      run directly from github, all of its code can be read, understood, and cloned. Some of you which made it this far
      will not understand the details of Chisel, but will see the potential. Some of you may understand how it works and
      what it provides-- but may nevertheless dislike the idea of Chisel. For you, I just ask that you give it a second
      thought. And of course there is the happy intersection of both groups that value true freedom and also understand 
      Web3 technology. You are the cohort that can best push decentralization forward.
